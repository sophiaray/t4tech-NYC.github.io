                    t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and gnc people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, web savviness, and computer science.
                    The tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. The skillsets required to engage with the tech community
                    are not exclusive to cishet chads.

                    All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
                    In that effort we enforce a short but effective Code of Conduct:

                    <p class="codeOfConduct">Don't Be Mean</p>
