                    t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and GNC people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, and computer science.
                    We believe that the tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. 
                    We work to enable trans and GNC people with the skillsets required to engage with and shape the tech community.

                    All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
                    In that effort we enforce our code of conduct:

                    <p class="codeOfConduct">Code of Conduct</p>
                
                    <p class="codeOfConductText"> 
                        Every t4tech event, online platform, organizing space, and networked communications space adheres to the following code of conduct. 
                        No hate speech, including racist, misogynist, xenophobic, white-nationalist, transphobic, homophobic, classist, ableist, or police-endorsing language of any kind is permitted, 
                        and anyone doing so will be removed and barred from the space as well as any following events. 
                        Our events are for the sole purpose of creating safer spaces for trans and GNC people to learn about computer science, software development, virtual technologies, and digital security.
                        <p>tldr: refer to the famous line from Grandmother Kate Bornstein, “Don’t be mean.”</p>

                <p class="upcomingEventDate">When: Monday August 13th @ 7pm</p>
                <p class="upcomingEventDate upcomingEventWhere">Where: <a href="http://www.bluestockings.com" target="blank">Bluestockings Bookstore</a> </p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    This is an intro level workshop to front end software engineering with the super hot Javascript library React. All skill levels are welcome! Laptops not required, but it doesn't hurt to code along with us.
                </p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    Seriously, even if you have no experience whatsoever in how to code, this will cover both a foundational understanding of <i>what software engineering really is</i> and a practical approach to development with React.
                    Also, because Daly likes to live life on the edge, we'll be live coding a full stack web application. >:)
                </p>

                <p>Accessibility: This venue is wheelchair accessible, the workshop will be a combination of visual and verbal materials.</p>
