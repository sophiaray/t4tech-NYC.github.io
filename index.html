                    t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and gnc people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, and computer science.
                    We believe that the tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. 
                    We work to enable trans and gnc people with the skillsets required to engage with and shape the tech community.

                    All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
                    In that effort we enforce the following

                    <p class="codeOfConduct">Code of Conduct</p>
                
                    <p class="codeOfConductText"> 
                        Every t4tech event, online platform, organizing space, and networked communications space adheres to the following code of conduct. 
                        No hate speech of any kind is permitted, and any perpetrator of it will be removed and barred from the space and any following events. 
                        Proliferation of any racist, misogynist, xenophobic, white-nationalist, transphobic, homophobic, classist, ableist, or police-endorsing 
                        language of any kind will be subject to removal from the space and any future events. We honor the first amendment by enforcing actionable 
                        consequences to those that practice their right to the freedom of speech with violence or hate. Any conflict of ideas (with the consent 
                        from all parties) is welcome to a space for discussion, but unless otherwise determined, that space is not at a t4tech event. Our events 
                        are for the sole purpose of creating safer spaces for trans and gender-nonconforming people to learn about computer science, software development, 
                        virtual technologies, and digital security. In short, this boils down to the famous line from Grandmother Kate Bornstein, “Don’t be mean.”

                <h2 class="upcomingEventTitle">Intro to Front End Software Engineering with React</h2>
                <p class="upcomingEventDate">Monday August 13th @ 7pm</p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    This is an intro level workshop to front end software engineering with the super hot Javascript library React. All skill levels are welcome! Laptops not required, but it doesn't hurt to code along with us.
                </p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    Seriously, even if you have no experience whatsoever in how to code, this will cover both a foundational understanding of <i>what software engineering really is</i> and also a practical approach to development with React.
                    Also, because Daly likes to live life on the edge, we'll be live coding a full stack web application. >:)
                </p>

                <p>Accessibility: This venue is wheelchair accessible, the workshop will be a combination of visual and verbal materials.</p>
