            <p>t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and GNC people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, and computer science. We believe that the tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. We work to enable trans and GNC people with the skillsets required to engage with and shape the tech community.</p>

            <h2 class="sectionHeader">Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p class="codeOfConductPreamble">All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
            In that effort we enforce our code of conduct:</p>
            <p class="codeOfConductText">Every t4tech event, online platform, organizing space, and networked communications space adheres to the following code of conduct. 
            No hate speech, including racist, misogynist, xenophobic, white-nationalist, transphobic, homophobic, classist, ableist, or police-endorsing language of any kind is permitted, 
            and anyone doing so will be removed and barred from the space as well as any following events. 
            Our events are for the sole purpose of creating safer spaces for trans and GNC people to learn about computer science, software development, virtual technologies, and digital security.
            <p>tldr: refer to the famous line from Grandmother Kate Bornstein, “Don’t be mean.”</p>

              <p class="eventDate">When: Tuesday September 4th @ 7pm</p>
              <p class="eventLocation">Where: <a href="http://www.bluestockings.com" target="blank">Bluestockings Bookstore</a> </p>
              <div class="eventDescription">
                <p>How do current dialogues of encryption and virtual privacy fail trans, queer, and sex worker communities?</p>
                <p>How can we protect ourselves and others online in the age of SESTA/FOSTA? This workshop will provide an overview of technologies and strategies to avoid digital surveillance, as well as threat modeling from a trans, gnc, and sw point of view. We will go over some broad topics and talking points as well as collectively build threat models for ourselves and our communities. Then we'll cover an analysis of safe/r VPNs, encryption browser plugins, obfuscation apps, and some analog methods that can be applied to our individual and collective threat models.</p>

                <p>Accessibility: This venue is wheelchair accessible, the workshop will be a combination of visual and verbal materials.</p>
