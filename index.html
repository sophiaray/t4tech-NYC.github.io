            <p>t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and GNC people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, and computer science. We believe that the tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. We work to enable trans and GNC people with the skillsets required to engage with and shape the tech community.</p>

            <h2 class="sectionHeader">Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p class="codeOfConductPreamble">All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
            In that effort we enforce our code of conduct:</p>
            <p class="codeOfConductText">Every t4tech event, online platform, organizing space, and networked communications space adheres to the following code of conduct. 
            No hate speech, including racist, misogynist, xenophobic, white-nationalist, transphobic, homophobic, classist, ableist, or police-endorsing language of any kind is permitted, 
            and anyone doing so will be removed and barred from the space as well as any following events. 
            Our events are for the sole purpose of creating safer spaces for trans and GNC people to learn about computer science, software development, virtual technologies, and digital security.
            <p>tldr: refer to the famous line from Grandmother Kate Bornstein, “Don’t be mean.”</p>

                  In response to the discussions that come from the panel on September 20th, these workshops will commence with a group exercise in the art of threat modeling, followed by several breakout workshops
                  in digital privacy and counter surveillance tactics that address those threat models. The workshops will cover a range of topics including but not limited to Tor, Signal, Virtual Private Networks,
                  Locking Down Social Media Accounts, encrypted communications, and cryptocurrencies as a sex work provider.
                  
                  <p>Tickets can be purchased <a href="https://eyebeam.secure.force.com/ticket/?isdtp=p1#sections_a0F6100000Jn5uWEAR" target="blank">here.</a>
