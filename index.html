                    t4tech is a free and accessible resource for transgender and gnc people to share and pick up skills of software engineering, digital technologies, and computer science.
                    We believe that the tech industry doesn't need to be inaccessible, unapproachable, and inordinately cissexist. 
                    We work to enable trans and gnc people with the skillsets required to engage with and shape the tech community.

                    All of our workshops, gatherings, and online resources aim to create a safer space that's anti-exclusionary and inherently flexible.
                    In that effort we enforce a short but effective Code of Conduct:

                    <p class="codeOfConduct">Don't Be Mean</p>

                <h2 class="upcomingEventTitle">Intro to Front End Software Engineering with React</h2>
                <p class="upcomingEventDate">Monday August 13th @ 7pm</p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    This is an intro level workshop to front end software engineering with the super hot Javascript library React. All skill levels are welcome! Laptops not required, but it doesn't hurt to code along with us.
                </p>
                <p class="upcomingEventText">
                    Seriously, even if you have no experience whatsoever in how to code, this will cover both a foundational understanding of <i>what software engineering really is</i> and also a practical approach to development with React.
                    Also, because Daly likes to live life on the edge, we'll be live coding a full stack web application. >:)
                </p>

                <p>Accessibility: This venue is wheelchair accessible, the workshop will be a combination of visual and verbal materials.</p>
